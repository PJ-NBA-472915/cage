# GitTool Staging Workflow Notes

## Reproducing the previous failure
1. Initialize a test repository and create or modify files via the EditorTool.
2. Call the `GitTool` commit operation without explicitly staging the edited files.
3. The pre-fix implementation returned `"No staged changes to commit"` even when there were obvious unstaged or untracked updates, forcing agents to retry blindly.

## Fix highlights
- `GitTool.add_files` now uses `git add --all`, ensuring deletions and renames are captured alongside new and modified files.
- `GitTool.commit` automatically stages pending work when the staging area is empty but changes exist, then retries the status check.
- Failure responses now include whether the working tree is clean or which paths remain unstaged so agents receive actionable feedback.

## Usage guidance
- Agent workflows can invoke the commit operation directly; the tool will stage pending changes first.
- When a commit genuinely has nothing to capture, the API returns `"No changes detected in the working tree"` instead of the generic staging error.
- For selective commits, provide an explicit file list to `add_files` before committing to avoid staging unrelated paths.
