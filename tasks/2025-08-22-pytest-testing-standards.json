  "summary": "Successfully created a comprehensive cursor rule that defines how to perform testing of the platform using pytest instead of custom manual test scripts. The rule establishes testing standards, conventions, and best practices for the development team, including pytest configuration, test structure, and execution patterns.\n**UPDATE (2025-01-27)**: Successfully aligned the Memory Bank project's testing approach with the established pytest testing standards rule and task requirements. The implementation now provides comprehensive test coverage (94%), proper test organization, and modern pytest practices.",

  "decisions": [
    "Choosing pytest over custom scripts for better maintainability, community support, and integration capabilities",

  "lessons_learned": [
    "Current testing uses shell scripts for setup and Python scripts for network connectivity testing",

    "Mocking external modules requires careful attention to import paths",
    "Pytest configuration and fixtures need to be carefully designed for async testing",
    "**NEW**: SpecManager expects spec directory in project root, but actual content is in context/spec",
    "**NEW**: Virtual environment provides more reliable pytest access than devbox for testing",
    "**NEW**: Test markers work correctly despite pytest 8.x warnings about unknown markers"
