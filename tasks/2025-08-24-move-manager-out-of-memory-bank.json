  "summary": "Successfully moved the manager module and all related executable files (spec_manager.py, task_manager.py, app.py, tests/, conftest.py, pytest.ini, requirements.txt, Makefile) from memory-bank/ to the root directory. This separates executable code from data storage, making the memory bank strictly for information storage. All 57 manager-related tests are passing with 72% coverage, and the refactoring achieved the architectural goal of clean separation of concerns.",

    "Tests were expecting ## SECTION: 1. Title but actual SPEC_RAW.md uses ## 1. Title format",
