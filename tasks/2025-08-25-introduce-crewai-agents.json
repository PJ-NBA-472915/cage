  "decisions": [
    "Use CrewAI framework for agent orchestration",
    "Implement three distinct agent types: validator, actor, checker",
    "Actor agent will have cursor CLI as a tool",

    "Virtual environment setup is crucial for dependency management on macOS",
    "BaseAgent class must be abstract due to execute_task method - concrete implementations needed for testing",
    "Validation logic uses weighted scoring (40% goals, 40% criteria, 20% outcomes) with 80% threshold for passing",
    "Keyword matching for goal validation is case-insensitive and requires 50% keyword match for individual goals",
    "Test data must be carefully crafted to match validation logic expectations",
    "Mocking CrewAI framework is essential for unit testing without external dependencies",
    "Progress tracking requires careful timestamp management and status updates",
    "Documentation should be centralized in memory-bank/docs/features/ for consistency"
