Currently each service has near-identical Dockerfiles with the same Python/UV setup. Move to a single Dockerfile with intermediate base images and service-specific targets to reduce duplication, improve build caching, and align with industry standards for microservice containerisation. Single unified environment with debug capabilities built-in.",
