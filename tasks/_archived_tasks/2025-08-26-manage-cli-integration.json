  "decisions": [
    "Use a flexible approach for CLI integration, allowing easy switching between Cursor and Gemini.",
    "Centralize CLI-specific logic and dependencies to minimize impact on core agent functionality.",
    "Decision: For Gemini integration, use the Gemini Python SDK instead of the Gemini CLI due to the CLI's interactive nature and lack of clear non-interactive command execution for arbitrary tasks.",
    "Decision: Since no existing tests cover the agent daemon's CLI processing, new functional tests will be created to verify Gemini SDK integration.",
    "Decision: Due to persistent Docker build issues, Docker-related steps (build, test) are being skipped. Documentation will be updated to reflect the current state and manual verification will be required."

  "lessons_learned": [
    "Managing CLI dependencies requires careful attention to environment variables, binary paths, and version compatibility.",
    "Clear documentation is crucial for enabling seamless transitions between different CLIs.",
    "Gemini CLI is primarily designed for interactive natural language prompts, making it unsuitable for direct programmatic command execution in the same way as Cursor CLI.",
    "Lack of dedicated unit/integration tests for core daemon functionality highlights a testing gap that needs to be addressed.",
    "Building complex Python packages like numpy within Docker can be resource-intensive and lead to compilation failures if resources are limited.",
    "Persistent Docker issues can block development progress and require external intervention or alternative strategies."
  ],
  "issues_risks": [
    "Risk: Incompatible CLI versions leading to unexpected behavior; Mitigation: Specify exact versions in Dockerfile.",
    "Risk: Residual dependencies from previous CLI causing conflicts; Mitigation: Thorough cleanup during de-integration.",
    "Risk: Breaking existing agent functionality during CLI switch; Mitigation: Comprehensive testing before and after changes.",
    "Risk: Significant code changes required to switch from Cursor CLI (subprocess call) to Gemini Python SDK (API calls).",
    "Risk: New functional tests might be complex to set up due to the daemon's nature (requires a running daemon, Redis, etc.).",
    "**BLOCKER**: Docker image build fails due to resource limitations during numpy compilation, preventing further testing and deployment. This requires external intervention (e.g., increasing Docker resources) or finding alternative build strategies (e.g., pre-built images, different base image, pinning numpy version)."
