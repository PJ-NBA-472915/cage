    { "text": "Interactive entrypoint launches a guided experience that helps users navigate the platform.", "checked": true },
    { "text": "Arrow-key navigation works for all menus, lists, and choices; mouse/enter/esc behave as expected.", "checked": true },
    { "text": "Headless parity: every interactive action is available via subcommands/flags with equivalent outcomes.", "checked": true },
    { "text": "Clear previews, confirmations, and abort paths; no irreversible changes without explicit confirmation.", "checked": true },
    { "text": "Pre-flight validation catches common misconfigurations and offers actionable remediation.", "checked": true },
    { "text": "Atomic writes to coordination/runtime_registry.json capture mode (interactive/headless), parameters, and results.", "checked": true },
    { "text": "docs/cli.md includes interactive walkthroughs, headless recipes, and troubleshooting.", "checked": true },
    { "text": "tests/test_cli.py covers interactive navigation (arrow keys), cancellations, error states, and representative headless permutations.", "checked": true }

  "acceptance_checks": [
    { "text": "Menus are navigable with ↑/↓; Enter confirms; Esc/CTRL+C cancels with no side-effects.", "checked": true },
    { "text": "Interactive and headless runs yield byte-for-byte equivalent results where deterministic.", "checked": true },
    { "text": "Cancelling at any point leaves the working tree and registry unchanged.", "checked": true }

  "subtasks": [
    "Scaffold CLI with Typer (commands), rich (output), and questionary (prompt_toolkit-based prompts) with argparse-only fallback.",
    "Design IA for the manager (sections, navigation, input collection, previews, confirmations).",
    "Implement interactive flow with arrow-key menus and validated inputs.",
    "Expose equivalent headless surface via subcommands/flags.",
    "Validation layer and guardrails for protected operations.",
    "Atomic registry updates and optional JSONL logs under .logs/.",
    "Documentation at docs/cli.md.",
    "Automated tests: simulate TTY for interactive; exercise headless permutations.",
    "Makefile targets: make manager and non-interactive helpers."

  "decisions": [
    "Primary UX stack: Typer + rich + questionary (prompt_toolkit) to guarantee arrow-key navigation.",
    "Degraded mode: argparse-only with basic input; if TTY/prompt lib missing, exit with guidance to install extras."

  "issues_risks": [
    "Non-interactive environments must not prompt; enforce --yes/--no-input and TTY detection.",
    "Package availability on minimal images; document extras installation and provide graceful fallback.",
    "The Makefile is currently not working due to environment issues with `devbox` and `git`. The `manage.py` script should be used directly instead."
